# Maker integration test setup example

This sample project runs a JavaScript program within the context
of a local Geth testnet with a deployed Dai 1.0 Credit System.

It assumes the presence of the
[`dapp` tool installed via Nix](https://dapp.tools).

It is also set up as a Travis continuous integration project.
